## ✅ What Works (Verified)

### Backend
- [x] Tasks persist to database
- [x] Calendar events persist to database
- [x] Contacts persist to database
- [x] Data survives server restarts
- [x] Filtering by status, priority, date range
- [x] Proper HTTP status codes (201, 204, 404)
- [x] Input validation and sanitization

### Frontends

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Security
- **No authentication** - Anyone with URL access can use it
- Single user only (SQLite limitations)
- No user accounts or permissions

### Features
- **No CalDAV/CardDAV sync** - Can't sync with Apple Calendar, Google Calendar
- **No task editing** in Telegram bot - Must delete and recreate
- **No real-time updates** - Web UI must be manually refreshed
- Files CRUD still stubs

### Infrastructure
- SQLite won't handle concurrent users
- 29/92 tests failing (infrastructure issues, not critical)
- No production deployment setup

## 🎯 Next Steps

### This Week: Daily Usage
**Goal**: Actually use it for real tasks/calendar/contacts

**Actions**:
1. Open Web UI: http://localhost:8501
2. Create 5-10 real tasks for this week
3. Add calendar events for meetings/appointments
4. Add contacts as you meet people
5. Use daily for task management

**Monitor**:
- What breaks?
- What's annoying?
- What's missing?
- Performance issues?

### After 1 Week: Assess & Fix
**Based on real usage**, identify and fix:
1. Top 3 pain points
2. Critical bugs
3. Most annoying UX issues

**Potential Improvements**:
- Add basic auth (single user JWT)
- Task editing in Web UI
- Data export/backup
- Better error messages
- Real-time updates

### Month 2: Decide Direction

**Option A - Personal Tool**:
- Keep as-is, use daily
- Add only what YOU need
- No auth needed
- **Score target**: 8/10

**Option B - Share with Others**:
- Add multi-user auth
- Migrate to PostgreSQL
- Add CalDAV sync
- Deploy to cloud
- **Score target**: 9/10 (3+ months work)

**Option C - Learn & Move On**:
- You built something that works!
- Apply learnings to next project
- Archive this as portfolio piece
